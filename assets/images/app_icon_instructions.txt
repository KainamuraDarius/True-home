To complete the app icon setup:

1. Save your TrueHome logo image as:
   - assets/images/app_icon.png (1024x1024 recommended)
   - assets/images/app_icon_foreground.png (For Android adaptive icons)

2. The logo should be:
   - Square format (1024x1024 pixels minimum)
   - PNG format with transparency
   - High resolution for best quality

3. After adding the images, run:
   flutter pub get
   dart run flutter_launcher_icons

Your current logo looks perfect! Just save it in these locations.
