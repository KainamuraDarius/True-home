Subject: URGENT: Sandbox API User Creation Failing - Request Manual Credentials

Hello MTN MoMo Developer Support Team,

I am unable to create API user credentials through your sandbox environment. All API calls are returning 500 Internal Server Error.

ISSUE DETAILS:
- Error: "statusCode": 500, "message": "Internal server error"
- Endpoint: POST https://sandbox.momodeveloper.mtn.com/v1_0/apiuser
- Date: January 30, 2026
- Multiple attempts with different UUIDs: All failing
- Different callback hosts tried: All failing
- Subscription Key: ec1bc2bfcfb3454d8188a0845e852912

APPLICATION DETAILS:
- Name: TrueHome Uganda
- Purpose: Hostel/Property booking platform with Mobile Money payment integration
- Product: Collection API
- Country: Uganda
- Expected Transaction Volume: 100-500 per month
- Integration Status: 95% complete, only waiting for API credentials

URGENT REQUEST:
Since the automated sandbox API user creation is not working, please:
1. Create API User ID manually for my subscription key
2. Generate API Key for this user
3. Provide credentials via email

OR

4. Confirm if I should proceed directly with Production API credentials instead

BUSINESS IMPACT:
My application is ready to launch but blocked by this sandbox issue. I have paying customers waiting for the payment integration to go live.

TECHNICAL ATTEMPTS MADE:
- Multiple UUID formats tested
- Different callback hosts tried (webhook.site, empty)
- Various HTTP headers combinations
- All returned 500 Internal Server Error

Please treat this as urgent. I can provide any additional information needed.

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone Number]
[Your Company Name]
